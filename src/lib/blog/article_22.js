        Prep Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>📥 <strong>Gather 1099s:</strong> You need the 1099-NEC and 1099-K forms. If you earned <$600, you might not get a form, but you MUST report the income anyway.</li>
        <li>🧾 <strong>Bank Statements:</strong> Do not rely on shoeboxes of receipts. Print your "Year End Summary" from your business bank account.</li>
        <li>🚗 <strong>Odometer:</strong> You need your odometer reading from Jan 1 and Dec 31. If you didn't track it, start now for next year.</li>
        <li>🏥 <strong>Health:</strong> Find your 1095-A if you have Marketplace insurance. You cannot file without it.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Tax anxiety usually stems from disorganization. The act of "Doing Taxes" is actually just data entry. The hard part is <em>finding</em> the data. If you spend 2 hours organizing your documents using this checklist, the actual filing process will take 30 minutes.</p>

    <h2 id="income-docs">1. Income Documents (The 1099s)</h2>
    <p>You cannot file until you have these. Filing before you receive them leads to amendments (see Article 24).</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>1099-NEC:</strong> Non-Employee Compensation. You get this from any client who paid you >$600 via check/ACH.</li>
        <li><strong>1099-K:</strong> Payment Card Transactions. You get this from Uber, DoorDash, Upwork, PayPal, Etsy if you had >$5,000 in transactions (the threshold varies by state, some are $600!).</li>
        <li><strong>W-2:</strong> If you had a part-time day job.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest/Dividends:</strong> 1099-INT and 1099-DIV from your bank/brokerage.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash/Venmo:</strong> Even if you didn't get a form, print your Venmo CSV. You must report all income.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="expense-receipts">2. Expense Receipts (The Write-offs)</h2>
    <p>Group these by "Category" to match the Schedule C lines. Do not just have a pile of "Business stuff."</p>

    <h2 id="home-office">3. Home Office Data</h2>
    <p>If you claim the Home Office Deduction (Article 11), you need specific measurements:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Square Footage of Office:</strong> Measure the room (e.g., 10x12 = 120 sq ft).</li>
        <li><strong>Total Square Footage of Home:</strong> Check your lease or Zillow (e.g., 1,200 sq ft).</li>
        <li><strong>Mortgage Interest / Rent Paid:</strong> Total for the year.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Total Electric, Gas, Water, Internet, and Insurance bills for the year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="vehicle-log">4. Vehicle Mileage Log</h2>
    <p>The IRS requires a contemporaneous log (Article 6). You need:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Total Mileage:</strong> Every mile driven for any purpose (Personal + Business).</li>
        <li><strong>Business Mileage:</strong> Just the miles for work.</li>
        <li><strong>Commuting Mileage:</strong> Miles from home to your first stop (usually not deductible).</li>
        <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Date of the trip, destination, and purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>If you use MileIQ or Hurdlr, export the "Annual Report" PDF.</em></p>

    <h2 id="retirement">5. Retirement Contributions</h2>
    <p>Did you contribute to a Traditional IRA, SEP-IRA, or Solo 401(k)?</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Form 5498:</strong> Your brokerage sends this, but often in May (too late).</li>
        <li><strong>Check your Portal:</strong> Login to Vanguard/Fidelity and check "2026 Contributions." You can deduct money contributed up until April 15, 2027!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="health">6. Health Insurance</h2>
    <p>If you pay for your own insurance, this is a huge "Above the Line" deduction (Article 12).</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Premiums Paid:</strong> Total amount you paid out of pocket.</li>
        <li><strong>Form 1095-A:</strong> Essential if you have a Marketplace plan. It calculates your Premium Tax Credit subsidy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="faq">Prep FAQs</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: How long do I keep these receipts?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">3 years minimum. 6 years recommended. Digital copies (scans/photos) are 100% acceptable to the IRS. You do not need the physical thermal paper (which fades anyway).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: My 1099 is wrong. What do I do?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Contact the client immediately and ask for a "Corrected 1099." Do not file the return with the wrong number—the IRS computer matches it automatically. If you file with a number different than the 1099, you will get a letter.</p>
