        Rental Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>🚗 <strong>Turo (Cars):</strong> Usually <strong>Schedule C</strong> (Subject to Self-Employment Tax). Why? Because you are providing a service, not just renting real estate.</li>
        <li>🏠 <strong>Airbnb (Houses):</strong> Usually <strong>Schedule E</strong> (Passive, NO Self-Employment Tax). This is a massive tax advantage.</li>
        <li>⚠️ <strong>The 7-Day Rule:</strong> If the average stay is 7 days or less, the IRS might try to reclassify your Airbnb as a "Hotel" (Schedule C).</li>
        <li>📉 <strong>Depreciation:</strong> You MUST depreciate the asset. If you don't, you lose the deduction, and the IRS still makes you pay recapture tax when you sell.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Gig Economy rentals are weird. You own an asset (Car/House) and you rent it out. Is this an "Investment" (like owning Apple stock) or a "Business" (like running a lemonade stand)?</p>
    <p><strong>The Stakes:</strong> <br/>
    If it's an <strong>Investment (Schedule E)</strong>: You pay 0% Self-Employment Tax. <br/>
    If it's a <strong>Business (Schedule C)</strong>: You pay 15.3% Self-Employment Tax.</p>
    <p>Obviously, you want Schedule E. But the IRS has strict rules.</p>

    <h2 id="turo-rules">Turo: Almost Always Schedule C</h2>
    <p>Many Turo hosts try to file on Schedule E to save that 15.3%. They are usually wrong.</p>
    <p><strong>IRS Logic:</strong> Renting personal property (like a car) where you are actively involved (washing it, delivering it, managing the listing) is a business.</p>
    <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> If you hire a "Fleet Manager" and you do NOTHING but collect a check, you might argue it is passive. But if you are the one vacuuming the sand out of the floor mats, you are working. You owe SE Tax.</p>

    <h2 id="airbnb-rules">Airbnb: The 7-Day Rule</h2>
    <p>Real Estate is naturally "Passive." So most rentals are Schedule E. <br/>
    However, <strong>Short-Term Rentals (STRs)</strong> complicate this.</p>
    <p><strong>Regulation 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A):</strong> <br/>
    Your rental is NOT "Rental Activity" (and thus might be a Business) if the <strong>Average Period of Customer Use is 7 days or less.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You rent your condo for weekends (Average stay: 3 days). <br/>
    <strong>IRS View:</strong> You are running a hotel. Hotels are businesses (Schedule C). <br/>
    <strong>The Loophole:</strong> Even if you fail the 7-day test, you can stay on Schedule E if you do <strong>NOT provide substantial services</strong> (like daily maid service, breakfast, tours). Just giving them a key and leaving them alone usually keeps you in "Rental" territory (Schedule E).</p>

    <h2 id="deductions">Specific Deductions (Cleaning/Service)</h2>
    <p>Whether C or E, you can deduct:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Turo:</strong> Car washes, insurance, Turo fees (the 25% cut), parking, repairs.</li>
        <li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> Cleaning fees, soap/shampoo, utilities, HOA fees, mortgage interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Fees:</strong> The Airbnb/Turo "Platform Fee" is your biggest deduction. Don't pay tax on the gross amount!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="depreciation">Depreciation (The Silent Killer)</h2>
    <p>You cannot deduct the cost of the Car ($30k) or House ($300k) all at once.</p>
    <p><strong>Turo:</strong> Depreciate the car over 5 years. (Or use Bonus Depreciation/Section 179 if eligible - see Article 26). <br/>
    <strong>Airbnb:</strong> Depreciate the building (not land) over 27.5 years (Residential) or 39 years (Commercial).</p>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Many people say "I won't depreciate my house because I don't want to deal with Recapture tax." <br/>
    <strong>IRS Rule:</strong> "Allowed or Allowable." When you sell, the IRS charges you Recapture Tax on the depreciation you <em>should have taken</em>, even if you didn't take it. So <strong>ALWAYS TAKE THE DEPRECIATION.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="audit-proofing">Audit Proofing Your Rentals</h2>
    <p>Separate bank accounts are mandatory. Turo income goes to Turo Bank Account. Car wash expense comes from Turo Bank Account. <br/>
    If you mix your Turo money with your personal grocery money, the IRS can disallow your "Business" status and classify it as a "Hobby" (income is taxable, expenses are disallowed).</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Rental FAQs</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Can I use the Standard Mileage Rate for Turo?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes, BUT you cannot switch back and forth. If you use Standard Mileage in Year 1, you must use it for the life of the car. If you use Actual Expenses (Gas/Insurance/Depreciation) in Year 1, you are stuck with Actual Expenses forever.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Do I need to collect Sales Tax?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Usually, the Platform (Airbnb/Turo) collects and remits sales tax for you ("Marketplace Facilitator Laws"). Check your dashboard tax settings to confirm. If they don't, YOU are responsible for sending that 10% to the state.</p>
