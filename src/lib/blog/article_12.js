      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>📉 <strong>The Benefit:</strong> You can deduct 100% of your premiums. This deduction lowers your "Adjusted Gross Income" (AGI), which helps you qualify for other breaks.</li>
        <li>🚫 <strong>The Spouse Rule:</strong> If you are <em>eligible</em> to join your spouse's employer plan (even if you decline it because it's expensive), you CANNOT take this deduction.</li>
        <li>📝 <strong>Profit Limit:</strong> The deduction cannot exceed your business profit. If you lost money this year, you can't deduct premiums.</li>
        <li>🏥 <strong>Includes:</strong> Medical, Dental, Vision, and Long-Term Care (up to age limits).</li>

    <p>In the corporate world, health insurance is invisible. It just disappears from your paycheck. In the freelance world, it is a painful monthly bill of $400, $800, or $1,200. <br/>
    The good news: The government allows Self-Employed individuals to deduct <strong>100%</strong> of these premiums. But you have to do the math right, especially if you get a subsidy.</p>

    <h2 id="above-the-line">What "Above the Line" Means</h2>
    <p>Most deductions (Charity, Mortgage Interest) are "Below the Line" (Itemized Deductions). They only help you if you have enough of them to beat the Standard Deduction.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction</strong> is specialized. It lives on <strong>Schedule 1</strong>. It is "Above the Line."</p>
    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong><br/>
    If you deduct $10,000 of premiums here, it lowers your AGI from $80,000 to $70,000. <br/>
    A lower AGI means:<br/>
    - Lower Student Loan payments (IDR plans).<br/>
    - More eligibility for Child Tax Credits.<br/>
    - Lower taxes on Investment Income.</p>

    <h2 id="eligibility">Are You Eligible? (The Spouse Rule)</h2>
    <p>There is one massive trap.</p>
    <div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 p-4 rounded-xl my-4">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-2">The Spouse Eligibility Test</h4>
        <p class="text-red-800 text-sm">You CANNOT take this deduction for any month you were eligible to participate in a subsidized health plan maintained by any employer of yours or your spouse.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Your wife works at Starbucks. She gets insurance. Adding you to her plan costs $500/month. <br/>
    You decide: "That's too expensive. I'll buy my own plan for $400/month."<br/>
    <strong>Result:</strong> That $400 is <strong>NOT DEDUCTIBLE</strong>. Why? Because you <em>could</em> have joined the Starbucks plan. The mere <em>option</em> disqualifies you.</p>

    <h2 id="marketplace-math">Marketplace Plans & Subsidies (1095-A)</h2>
    <p>If you buy insurance on Healthcare.gov, you might get a "Premium Tax Credit" (Subsidy) that lowers your monthly bill.</p>
    <p><strong>The Circular Logic Problem:</strong><br/>
    1. Your Subsidy depends on your Income.<br/>
    2. Your Income depends on your Insurance Deduction.<br/>
    3. Your Insurance Deduction depends on how much you paid (which depends on the Subsidy).</p>
    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Tax software handles this iterative calculation. But you MUST have <strong>Form 1095-A</strong>. <br/>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> You can only deduct the amount you <em>actually paid</em> out of pocket. If the plan is $1,000 and the government pays $800 (so you pay $200), you deduct $200.</p>

    <h2 id="medicare">Medicare & Dental/Vision</h2>
    <p>Good news for older freelancers.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Medicare Part B & D:</strong> These premiums ARE deductible as Self-Employed Health Insurance! (Only if you are not covered by an employer plan).</li>
        <li><strong>Supplemental (Medigap):</strong> Also deductible.</li>
        <li><strong>Dental & Vision:</strong> Standalone policies are 100% deductible using the same rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="long-term-care">Long-Term Care Premiums</h2>
    <p>If you buy LTC insurance, you can deduct the premiums, but there is an age-based cap (2026 Limits projected):</p>

    <h2 id="tax-return">Where to Enter It (Schedule 1)</h2>
    <p>Many people mistakenly put this on Schedule A (Medical Expenses). <br/>
    <strong>Don't do that.</strong> Schedule A has a "7.5% of AGI" floor, meaning the first $5,000+ of expenses are wasted.<br/>
    <strong>Put it on Schedule 1, Line 17.</strong> There is no floor. Every dollar counts.</p>
