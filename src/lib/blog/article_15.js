        Startup Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>🚀 <strong>The Rule:</strong> You can deduct up to $5,000 of "Startup Costs" and $5,000 of "Organizational Costs" in the FIRST year your business is active.</li>
        <li>📉 <strong>The Excess:</strong> If you spent more than $5,000, you can't deduct the rest instantly. You must amortize it over 15 years (180 months).</li>
        <li>⏳ <strong>Timing:</strong> These are costs incurred <em>before</em> the day your business officially "Begins Operations."</li>
        <li>💀 <strong>Dead Projects:</strong> If you research a business but never launch it, the costs are legally considered "Personal Expenses" and are generally non-deductible.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>You spent 6 months building your app. You paid for market research ($2,000), a lawyer to form the LLC ($1,000), and a web designer ($3,000). You didn't make a single sale until December 1st.</p>
    <p><strong>The Question:</strong> Can you deduct those $6,000 of expenses on your tax return?</p>
    <p><strong>The Answer:</strong> Yes, but it's complicated. Normal business expenses are only deductible if the business <em>exists</em>. Before you launch, the business technically doesn't exist. The IRS calls these "Start-up Expenditures," and they live under a special code section: <strong>Section 195</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="the-problem">The "Pre-Opening" Problem</h2>
    <p>The IRS draws a hard line in the sand on the day your business <strong>"Begins Active Trade or Business."</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Before Day 1:</strong> Costs are Capital Expenses (Startup Costs).</li>
        <li><strong>After Day 1:</strong> Costs are Ordinary Business Expenses (fully deductible).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you launch on July 1st, the advertising you bought in June is a "Startup Cost." The advertising you buy in July is a "Business Expense."</p>

    <h2 id="section-195">The Solution: IRS Section 195</h2>
    <p>By default, you can't deduct startup costs at all. You have to "Capitalize" them (add them to the value of the business) and deduct them only when you sell the company.</p>
    <p>However, you can make an <strong>Election</strong> under Section 195 to deduct them early.</p>
    <p><strong>The Deduction Limits:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>First $5,000:</strong> Deductible immediately in Year 1.</li>
        <li><strong>The Phase-Out:</strong> If your startup costs exceed $50,000, the $5,000 deduction is reduced dollar-for-dollar. (So if you spend $55,000, you get $0 immediate deduction).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="eligible-costs">What Costs Qualify?</h2>
    <p>There are two buckets.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-800 mt-4">Bucket A: Startup Costs</h3>
    <p>Costs to investigate/create the business.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Market research / Surveys.</li>
        <li>Travel to meet distributors/suppliers.</li>
        <li>Advertisements for the "Opening Soon" launch.</li>
        <li>Salaries for training employees before opening.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-800 mt-4">Bucket B: Organizational Costs</h3>
    <p>Costs to legally form the entity.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Legal fees for drafting the LLC Operating Agreement.</li>
        <li>State filing fees.</li>
        <li>Accountant fees for setting up the books.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note: You get a SEPARATE $5,000 limit for Organizational Costs. So you can theoretically deduct $5,000 Startup + $5,000 Org Costs = $10,000 total.</em></p>

    <h2 id="amortization">The 15-Year Wait (Amortization)</h2>
    <p>What if you spent $12,000 on startup costs?</p>
    <p><strong>The Math:</strong><br/>
    Total Spent: $12,000.<br/>
    Immediate Deduction: -$5,000.<br/>
    <strong>Remaining Balance: $7,000.</strong></p>
    <p>You cannot deduct that $7,000 in Year 2. You must <strong>Amortize</strong> it over 180 months (15 years).</p>
    <p><strong>Monthly Deduction:</strong> $7,000 / 180 = <strong>$38.88 per month.</strong><br/>
    This is pitiful. It takes 15 years to get your money back.</p>
    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> If possible, delay paying for expensive items (like a big marketing retainer) until <strong>AFTER</strong> you launch. Then they count as ordinary expenses and are 100% deductible immediately, avoiding the 15-year trap.</p>

    <h2 id="the-deadline">The "Open for Business" Date</h2>
    <p>You must pick a date. The IRS defines this as when the business begins to function as a going concern.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br/>
    You build a website in Jan. <br/>
    You buy inventory in Feb.<br/>
    You open the store in March.<br/>
    You make your first sale in April.<br/>
    <strong>Start Date: March.</strong> (When you were ready to serve customers). You don't need to make a sale to be "Open," but you must be <em>trying</em> to make a sale.</p>

    <h2 id="failed-startup">What if the Business Fails?</h2>
    <p>This is salt in the wound.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario A: You launched, then failed.</strong><br/>
    You can deduct the remaining unamortized startup costs as a "Business Capital Loss" on Form 4797.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario B: You researched it, but never launched (never bought the domain/LLC).</strong><br/>
    These are "Personal Expenses." <strong>$0 Deduction.</strong> The IRS says you were just thinking about it, so it wasn't a business yet.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Startup FAQs</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Does buying a computer count as a Startup Cost?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">No. Tangible assets (Computers, Desks, Machinery) are <strong>Assets</strong>. They are handled under Depreciation (Section 179), not Startup Costs. You can usually write them off 100% when placed in service, separate from the $5,000 limit.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: How do I claim the election?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">You claim it by filing your tax return for the year the business begins and claiming the deduction on Part V of Schedule C ("Other Expenses"). You must file on time (including extensions). If you file late, you might lose the right to the election!</p>
