        Office Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>📏 <strong>Simplified Method:</strong> $5 per square foot. Max 300 sq ft ($1,500). Easy, audit-proof, no depreciation.</li>
        <li>🧾 <strong>Actual Expenses:</strong> Deduct a %, of Rent, Utilities, and Repairs. Better for Renters in expensive cities.</li>
        <li>🔒 <strong>Exclusive Use:</strong> The space must be used 100% for business. A laptop on the kitchen table does NOT count.</li>
        <li>🏠 <strong>Homeowners:</strong> "Actual Expenses" requires you to depreciate your home, which triggers a tax recapture when you sell. Be careful. Simplified is usually safer.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>For decades, accountants whispered: "Don't claim the home office deduction! It's a red flag!" <br/>
    That advice is outdated. In 2026, with millions of remote workers, the home office is the norm, not the exception. The IRS knows this. They even created a "Simplified Method" to encourage you to take it.</p>

    <h2 id="exclusive-use">The "Exclusive Use" Rule</h2>
    <p>Before you do math, you must pass the test.</p>
    <p><strong>The Test:</strong> The area must be used <strong>exclusively</strong> and <strong>regularly</strong> for business.</p>
    <p><strong>Pass:</strong> A spare bedroom with a desk, chair, and printer. You never sleep there. <br/>
    <strong>Fail:</strong> The dining room table. (You eat dinner there).<br/>
    <strong>Fail:</strong> The guest bedroom. (Grandma sleeps there twice a year). <br/>
    <strong>Pass (Hack):</strong> A visualized portion of a room. If you have a large living room and use a room divider to partition off a 10x10 section that is ONLY for work, that counts.</p>

    <h2 id="method-1">Method 1: Simplified ($5/sqft)</h2>
    <p>Introduced to save time.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Math:</strong> Square Footage x $5.</li>
        <li><strong>Cap:</strong> 300 sq ft ($1,500 max deduction).</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> No receipts needed. No calculations. No depreciation recapture later.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Cap is low. If you live in NYC and pay $4,000 rent, a $1,500 deduction is tiny.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="method-2">Method 2: Actual Expenses</h2>
    <p>This is the "classic" way. You treat your home as a corporate headquarters.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Calculate Percentage.</strong><br/>
    Office Area: 150 sq ft.<br/>
    Total Home: 1,500 sq ft.<br/>
    <strong>Business Use %: 10%.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Apply to Bills.</strong><br/>
    Rent/Mortgage Interest: $24,000.<br/>
    Utilities (Electric/Gas/Water): $3,000.<br/>
    Insurance: $500.<br/>
    Repairs (Whole House): $1,000.<br/>
    <strong>Total: $28,500 x 10% = $2,850 Deduction.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Direct Expenses:</em> If you paint the office walls (only the office), that is 100% deductible.</p>

    <h2 id="depreciation">Depreciation Recapture (The Trap)</h2>
    <p>If you own your home and use "Actual Expenses," you MUST depreciate the "Office Portion" of your home structure (over 39 years).</p>
    <p><strong>The Trap:</strong> When you sell your house 10 years later for a profit, the IRS says: "Hey, we let you depreciate that office. Now you have to pay us back." <br/>
    You will pay a special 25% tax on the depreciation you claimed (or <em>could have</em> claimed). <br/>
    <strong>The Simplified Method avoids this entirely.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="audit-risk">Is It an Audit Trigger?</h2>
    <p>Simplifed Method? No. <br/>
    Actual Expenses? Only if the percentage is unreasonable.</p>
    <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> Claiming 40% of your home is business use. <br/>
    <strong>Safe Zone:</strong> 5% to 15% is standard. <br/>
    If you live in a Studio Apartment and claim 50% is an office, do you sleep standing up? The IRS will ask.</p>

            <p class="text-text-muted">NO. The TCJA eliminated the home office deduction for <strong>Employees (W-2)</strong>. Even if your boss <em>requires</em> you to work from home. This deduction is ONLY for 1099 Self-Employed business owners.</p>

            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes, but only the business percentage. If you use the internet for 8 hours of work and 4 hours of Netflix, it's ~66% business. Be reasonable.</p>
