    <p>When you were an employee, your boss withheld taxes from every paycheck. You never saw the money, so you never missed it. Now that you are a freelancer, you get the full check. It feels great.</p>
    <p>But the US has a "Pay-As-You-Go" tax system. The IRS requires you to pay taxes as you earn the money throughout the year. If you wait until April 15 to pay it all, they will slap you with an <strong>Underpayment Penalty</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="why-pay">Pay-As-You-Go System</h2>
    <p>The rule is simple: If you expect to owe more than <strong>$1,000</strong> in tax when you file your return, you must make quarterly payments.</p>
    <p>For a freelancer, owing $1,000 in tax happens very fast. Since Self-Employment Tax is 15.3%, you only need to earn ~$6,500 in profit to hit the threshold. Basically, everyone needs to pay quarterly.</p>

    <h2 id="dates">2026 Deadlines (Save These)</h2>
    <p>The IRS fiscal quarters are weird. They are not 3 months each. Q2 is only 2 months long (April-May). This trips everyone up.</p>

    <h2 id="safe-harbor">The Safe Harbor Rule (Critical)</h2>
    <p>This is the most important concept in freelance tax planning. Estimating your exact income for 2026 is impossible. What if you lose a client? What if you go viral?</p>
    <p>The IRS gives you an out: <strong>The Safe Harbor Rule.</strong></p>
    <p>You will owe <strong>$0 penalties</strong> if your quarterly payments equal the SMALLER of:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 my-4 font-medium text-slate-800">
        <li><strong>90% of your Current Year (2026) Tax:</strong> Hard to predict.</li>
        <li><strong>100% of your Prior Year (2025) Tax:</strong> Easy to know! (Look at Line 24 on your last 1040).</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Always use Method #2. <br/>
    If your total tax in 2025 was $10,000, just pay $2,500 per quarter in 2026. <br/>
    Even if you make $1 Million in 2026 and owe $400,000 in tax, <strong>you will not be penalized</strong> for underpayment as long as you paid that Safe Harbor amount. You can pay the remaining $390,000 on April 15 with no penalty.</p>
    <p><em>Note: High Earners (AGI > $150k) must pay 110% of prior year tax to be safe.</em></p>

    <h2 id="how-to-calc">How to Calculate Usage</h2>
    <p>If you don't have a prior year (this is your first year in business), you must estimate.</p>
    <p><strong>The Napkin Math Method:</strong> Set aside 25-30% of every check.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>15.3% for Self-Employment Tax.</li>
        <li>10-15% for Income Tax.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you use our <a href="/">Tax Calculator</a>, it tells you exactly what to set aside. Just pay that amount.</p>

    <h2 id="how-to-pay">How to Pay (Direct Pay)</h2>
    <p>Do not mail a check. Checks get lost. Use the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/direct-pay" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-600 underline">IRS Direct Pay</a> tool.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
        <li>Go to IRS Direct Pay (no login required).</li>
        <li>Select Reason: "Estimated Tax".</li>
        <li>Select Apply To: "1040ES (for 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ)".</li>
        <li>Select Tax Year: "2026".</li>
        <li> Verify your identity with an old tax return.</li>
        <li>Enter your bank info.</li>
        <li>Print the receipt. Save it as a PDF.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="penalty">The Underpayment Penalty</h2>
    <p>What happens if you skip a payment?</p>
    <p>The IRS charges an interest-based penalty. It is basically an interest rate (currently around 8%) charged on the days the money was late.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You skipped the $2,000 June payment and paid it in September. You are 3 months late.<br/>
    Penalty = $2,000 * 8% * (3/12) = ~$40.</p>
    <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> The penalty is not catastrophic. If you are strapped for cash, it is often cheaper to pay the IRS penalty (8%) than to put tax on a credit card (24%). Don't panic, just catch up when you can.</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Do I have to pay state estimated taxes too?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes. Most states follow the same schedule. California, New York, etc. want their cut quarterly too. Check your state's Department of Revenue website.</p>
