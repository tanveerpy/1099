        Audit Defense Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>🚩 <strong>Consistency:</strong> The IRS computer looks for "outliers." If you claim $50k income and $48k travel expenses, you are flagged.</li>
        <li>🏦 <strong>Separation:</strong> Never pay personal expenses from a business account. It violates the "Exclusive Use" principle.</li>
        <li>🧾 <strong>Digital Proof:</strong> Bank statements are NOT receipts. You need the actual invoice showing <em>what</em> was bought.</li>
        <li>🚗 <strong>Mileage:</strong> A log created at the end of the year is invalid. It must be "contemporaneous" (created at the time of the trip).</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The word "Audit" strikes fear into the heart of every freelancer. We imagine men in black suits storming our home office. In reality, most audits are "Correspondence Audits"—just a letter asking for proof of a specific number. <br/>
    If you are organized, an audit is a minor annoyance. If you are disorganized, it is a catastrophe.</p>

    <h2 id="red-flags">Top 5 IRS Red Flags for 2026</h2>
    <p>The IRS uses a "Discriminant Function System" (DIF) score to grade every return. High score = High Audit Risk. Here is what raises your score:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Perfect Round Numbers:</strong> Claiming exactly $5,000 for Advertising. Real life is messy. Claim $4,982.17. Round numbers imply guessing.</li>
        <li><strong>High Meal Expenses:</strong> Claiming meals >10% of your gross income looks suspicious.</li>
        <li><strong>100% Business Use of Car:</strong> Claiming you drove your only car 20,000 miles for work and 0 miles for personal use is statistically impossible.</li>
        <li><strong>Home Office Deduction:</strong> It used to be a red flag. Now it's common, but claiming a huge percentage of your home (e.g., 50%) is still dangerous.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistently Reporting a Loss:</strong> If your business loses money for 3 years in a row, the IRS classifies it as a "Hobby" and disallows all past deductions. You must show a profit in 3 out of 5 years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bank-zero">The "Bank Zero" Method</h2>
    <p>This is the single most effective way to audit-proof your life.</p>
    <p><strong>The Rule:</strong> Every single business transaction must pass through ONE dedicated Business Checking Account.</p>
    <p><strong>The Protocol:</strong><br/>
    1. <strong>Income:</strong> All client payments go to Business Checking.<br/>
    2. <strong>Expenses:</strong> All software, equipment, and contractor payments come OUT of Business Checking.<br/>
    3. <strong>Pay Yourself:</strong> When you need money for rent/groceries, transfer a lump sum (e.g., $2,000) to your Personal Checking. Label it "Owner Draw."<br/>
    <strong>Why this works:</strong> In an audit, you simply hand the auditor your 12 Business Bank Statements. You say: "If it's on this statement, it's business. If it's not, it's personal." You have eliminated the "Commingling" argument instantly.</p>

    <h2 id="receipts">Digital Receipts Strategy</h2>
    <p>A credit card statement showing "Amazon - $50" is <strong>NOT</strong> sufficient proof. The IRS needs to know <em>what</em> you bought (was it a Business Book or a Video Game?). You need the itemized invoice.</p>
    <p><strong>The Workflow:</strong><br/>
    1. Create a Gmail label: "2026 Tax Receipts".<br/>
    2. Every time you buy something online, auto-filter the receipt to that label.<br/>
    3. For physical receipts (coffee), snap a photo with Google Drive Scan or Dropbox Scan immediately. Then throw the paper away.<br/>
    4. <strong>Do not keep paper.</strong> Thermal receipts fade in 6 months. Digital copies are safer.</p>

    <h2 id="commingling">The Commingling Trap</h2>
    <p>Using your Business Card to buy groceries "just this one time" is a fatal error. <br/>
    <strong>The Auditor's Logic:</strong> "You bought diapers on the business card here. How do I know this 'Office Supply' charge wasn't also personal? I can no longer trust your separation. I am now going to investigate ALL your personal accounts too."<br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> If you accidentally use the wrong card, write a check from your personal account to the business account for the exact amount. Note it as "Reimbursement for personal error." This shows you caught it and corrected it.</p>

    <h2 id="reconstruction">Disaster Recovery (Lost Receipts)</h2>
    <p>What if you lost everything? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohan_rule" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-600 underline">Cohan Rule</a> is a famous court case (George M. Cohan v. Commissioner, 1930). It established that if you can prove an expense <em>must</em> have occurred, you can estimate it.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You are a traveling salesman. You lost your hotel receipts. But you can prove you were in Chicago for a client meeting via emails. The court allows you to deduct a "reasonable" per diem rate for the hotel, even without the receipt.<br/>
    <em>Note: This does NOT apply to Travel/Meals/Entertainment (Section 274(d)), which have stricter rules. But it works for office supplies and postage.</em></p>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: How far back can they audit?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">3 Years for normal errors. 6 Years if you understated income by >25%. Unlimited (Forever) if you committed Civil Fraud or never filed a return.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Should I go to the audit myself?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Absolutely not. Never talk to the IRS directly if you are under audit. Hire an Enrolled Agent (EA) or CPA. They speak the language. You might accidentally say something harmless ("I take the car to the beach on weekends") that disallows your entire car deduction. Let the pros handle it.</p>
