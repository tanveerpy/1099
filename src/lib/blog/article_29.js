      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>⚖️ <strong>Tax Rate:</strong> 0% Difference. An LLC pays the exact same taxes as a Sole Prop (unless you elect S-Corp status).</li>
        <li>🛡️ <strong>Asset Protection:</strong> An LLC protects your personal savings and home from business lawsuits. A Sole Prop puts everything at risk.</li>
        <li>🎭 <strong>Privacy:</strong> An LLC allows you to use an EIN instead of your SSN on client forms.</li>
        <li>💸 <strong>Cost:</strong> Sole Props are free. LLCs can cost $800/year (California) or $300 one-time (Texas).</li>
      </ul>

    <p>One of the first questions every new freelancer asks is: "Do I need an LLC?" The internet is filled with bad advice suggesting that an LLC is a magical tax-saving device. It is not. In the eyes of the IRS, a "Single-Member LLC" is a "Disregarded Entity." This means the IRS ignores the existence of the LLC and taxes you, the individual, directly.</p>
    <p>However, taxes are not the only reason to exist. The Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a legal shield designed to separate your business life from your personal life.</p>

    <h2 id="tax-reality">The Great Tax Neutrality</h2>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> You save exactly $0.00 in taxes by forming an LLC. The only way an LLC saves tax is if you file Form 2553 to be taxed as an <strong>S-Corp</strong> (see Article 18), but you usually need $80k+ profit for that to make sense.</p>

    <h2 id="liability">Liability: The "Pizza Delivery" Scenario</h2>
    <p>If taxes are the same, why bother? <strong>Liability Protection.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Scenario:</strong> You are a freelance videographer. On a shoot, you accidentally knock over a light stand. It falls and breaks the leg of the Bride at a wedding. The Bride sues you for $250,000 in medical bills and damages.</p>
    
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Option A: You are a Sole Proprietorship</h3>
    <p>You and your business are the same person. The lawsuit names "YOU" as the defendant. <br/>
    The court awards the Bride $250,000. Your business bank account only has $5,000. <br/>
    <strong>The Result:</strong> The court can seize your personal savings, place a lien on your personal house, and garnish your future wages. You are personally bankrupt.</p>

    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Option B: You are an LLC</h3>
    <p>The lawsuit names "Ace Video LLC" as the defendant. <br/>
    The court awards the Bride $250,000. The LLC bank account has $5,000. <br/>
    <strong>The Result:</strong> The LLC pays the $5,000. The LLC declares bankruptcy and dissolves. <br/>
    <strong>Crucially:</strong> The court CANNOT touch your personal house, your car, or your personal savings. Your loss is limited ("Limited Liability") to what was inside the company.</p>

    <h2 id="piercing-veil">How to Lose Your Protection (Piercing the Veil)</h2>
    <p>Liability protection is not magic. You have to earn it. If you treat your LLC like a piggy bank, a judge will "Pierce the Corporate Veil" and hold you personally liable anyway.</p>
    <p><strong>Top 3 Ways to Break the Veil:</strong></p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
        <li><strong>Commingling Funds:</strong> Buying groceries with the business card. Paying rent with the business account. The moment you mix funds, you prove the entities are not separate.</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud:</strong> Using the LLC to scam people.</li>
        <li><strong>Undercapitalization:</strong> Starting a dangerous business (like demolition) with $0 in the bank and no insurance, knowing you can't pay for damages.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Open a business checking account. All revenue goes in. Expected business expenses go out. If you need money personally, transfer a lump sum labeled "Owner's Draw" to your personal account first, THEN spend it.</p>

    <h2 id="privacy">Privacy & Credibility</h2>
    <p><strong>Identity Theft Protection:</strong><br/>
    As a Sole Prop, your Tax ID is your Social Security Number. Any client paying you >$600 needs a W-9 form. That means email your SSN to strangers constantly. <br/>
    As an LLC, you get an <strong>EIN (Employer Identification Number)</strong> for free from the IRS. You put the EIN on the W-9. Your SSN stays in your safe.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The "Pro" Factor:</strong><br/>
    "John Smith" looks like a guy doing a side hustle. "Smith Creative Solutions, LLC" looks like a vendor. Many corporate clients have compliance rules that forbid them from hiring Sole Proprietors due to "Worker Misclassification" risks. Having an LLC makes you easier to hire for big contracts.</p>

    <h2 id="formation-steps">How to Form an LLC (DIY Guide)</h2>
    <p>You do not need to pay LegalZoom $300 + filing fees. You can do it yourself in 20 minutes.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 my-6">
        <li><strong>Name Search:</strong> Go to your Secretary of State website. Search your desired name. E.g., "Neon Design LLC". Ensure it's available.</li>
        <li><strong>File "Articles of Organization":</strong> This is the form. It asks for your address and a "Registered Agent" (you can be your own agent if you live in the state). Pay the fee online.</li>
        <li><strong>Get an EIN:</strong> Go to IRS.gov. Apply for an EIN online. It is free and instant (Business Hours only).</li>
        <li><strong>Operating Agreement:</strong> This is a documented contract laying out how the business runs. For single-member LLCs, you can download a free template. You don't file this; just sign it and keep it.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Bank Account:</strong> Take your Articles of Organization + EIN to a bank (Chase, Mercury, Relay) and open a Business Checking account.</li>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Can I form an LLC in Delaware if I live in California?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">You can, but it's a mistake. If you live and work in California, you must register your Delaware LLC as a "Foreign LLC" in California. This means you pay the Delaware fee ($300) AND the California fee ($800). Double payment. Unless you are raising Venture Capital, form the LLC in the state where you actually live.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Does an LLC protect me if I personally injure someone?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">No. You are always personally liable for your own "Torts" (wrongdoing). If you punch a client, the LLC won't save you. The LLC protects you from <em>business</em> liabilities (breach of contract, employee mistakes, slip-and-falls on premises).</p>
