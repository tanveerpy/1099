        Strategy Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>💰 <strong>Strategy:</strong> Pay your child up to the Standard Deduction (~$14,600). They pay $0 Federal Income Tax on it.</li>
        <li>📉 <strong>Savings:</strong> You deduct that $14,600 as a business wage expense, saving you ~$4,000 - $6,000 in your taxes.</li>
        <li>🚫 <strong>No FICA:</strong> If you are a Sole Prop (not an S-Corp) hiring a child under 18, you do NOT have to withhold Social Security or Medicare taxes. It tax-free on both sides.</li>
        <li>📝 <strong>Compliance:</strong> It must be a REAL job (cleaning, filing, modeling). You must keep timesheets. You must pay a reasonable hourly rate.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>This is widely considered the "Rich Dad Poor Dad" tax strategy. It is one of the few loopholes that feels "too good to be true" but is explicitly written into the tax code.</p>
    <p><strong>The Gist:</strong> Instead of giving your kid a $200 allowance (with after-tax money), you pay them $200 to shred papers (with pre-tax business money). Same cash flow, dramatically different tax bill.</p>

    <h2 id="the-math">The Core Concept: Income Shifting</h2>
    <p>Imagine you earn $100,000 and are in the 22% tax bracket.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario A: Allowance</strong><br/>
    You pay your kid $10,000 allowance. <br/>
    You had to earn ~$14,000 to have that $10,000 left over after taxes. <br/>
    <strong>Cost to Family: $4,000 in taxes.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Scenario B: Salary</strong><br/>
    You pay your kid $10,000 wages. <br/>
    Your business deducts $10,000. This saves you ~$3,000 in income tax and ~$1,500 in SE Tax. <br/>
    Your kid receives $10,000. Because it's under the standard deduction, they pay $0 tax.<br/>
    <strong>Benefit to Family: ~$4,500 tax savings.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="standard-deduction">The $14,600 Magic Number</h2>
    <p>Every US taxpayer, even a 6-year-old, gets a <strong>Standard Deduction</strong>. For 2026, it is projected to be around <strong>$14,600</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means the first $14,600 of earned income is taxed at 0%. <br/>
    So you can pay your child up to this amount completely tax-free. They don't even technically need to file a return (though you should file one anyway to document the Roth IRA eligibility).</p>

    <h2 id="rules">The Rules (Don't Get Audited)</h2>
    <p>The IRS watches this closely. You can't just write a check to a 3-year-old for "Consulting."</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 my-6">
        <li><strong>Real Work:</strong> The work must be "ordinary and necessary" for the business.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasonable Pay:</strong> You must pay a market rate. Paying $500/hour for "Office Cleaning" is fraud. Paying $20/hour is reasonable.</li>
        <li><strong>Age Appropriate:</strong> A 12-year-old can do data entry. A 5-year-old cannot. (Though a 5-year-old CAN be a model for your website).</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> You need a signed Employment Agreement and weekly Timesheets. "Jan 5: 2 hours shredding. Jan 6: 1 hour cleaning."</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Method:</strong> You must actually pay them. Check or Direct Deposit into a custodial account in THEIR name. You can't just keep the money.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="jobs">Valid Jobs for a 7-Year-Old?</h2>
    <p>Is this practical?</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Age 0-6:</strong> Modeling (Photos for website/social media). This is highly defensible.</li>
        <li><strong>Age 7-11:</strong> Office Cleaning, Shredding, Stuffing Envelopes.</li>
        <li><strong>Age 12-15:</strong> Data Entry, Social Media Management, Editing Videos, Research.</li>
        <li><strong>Age 16+:</strong> Anything a normal employee would do.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="roth-ira">The Roth IRA Supercharger</h2>
    <p>Here is the real wealth unlock. Since your child now has "Earned Income," they qualify for a <strong>Custodial Roth IRA</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you pay them $7,000, they can put that full $7,000 into a Roth IRA.<br/>
    If they invest that $7,000 at age 10, and it grows at 8% until age 65, that SINGLE contribution becomes <strong>~$480,000 tax-free</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="payroll">How to Pay Them (W-2 Required)</h2>
    <p>You cannot just pay cash.</p>
    <p><strong>Sole Proprietors (Single LLC):</strong><br/>
    You do NOT need to withhold Social Security/Medicare (FICA) or FUTA (Unemployment) for children under 18. <br/>
    You DO need to issue a W-2. (Not a 1099. A 1099 implies they are an independent contractor, which a child is not).</p>
    <p><strong>S-Corp Owners:</strong><br/>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> The FICA exemption does NOT apply to Corporations. If your S-Corp hires your kid, the S-Corp must pay 15.3% payroll tax on their wages. This eats into the savings. <br/>
    <em>Workaround:</em> Some people start a separate "Family Management Company" (Sole Prop) to hire the kids, then have the S-Corp hire the Management Company. Ask a CPA.</p>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Do they have to spend the money?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">No. The money belongs to them, but it can be used for "Support" extras like summer camps, private school tuition (maybe), dance lessons, or college savings (529 plan). It just can't be used for basic food/shelter that you carry a legal obligation to provide.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Do I need Workers Comp insurance?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Maybe. State laws vary. Many states exclude family members from mandatory workers comp, but check your state labor board.</p>
