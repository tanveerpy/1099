    <p>The rules for meals have changed wildly over the last decade. In 2021-2022, meals were temporarily 100% deductible to support restaurants during COVID. <br/>
    <strong>That is over.</strong> In 2026, we are back to the strict TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) rules. Misunderstanding this is the easiest way to fail an audit.</p>

    <h2 id="the-split">The 3 Buckets (0%, 50%, 100%)</h2>
    <p>You need to categorize every food receipt into one of these three buckets. Most accounting software defaults to "Meals & Entertainment," which is dangerous because it mixes them.</p>

    <h2 id="entertainment-ban">Entertainment is DEAD (0%)</h2>
    <p>This is the biggest shock. Prior to 2018, you could take a Client to a Giants game and deduct 50% of the tickets. <br/>
    <strong>Now:</strong> You can deduct $0 of the tickets. <br/>
    <em>Nuance:</em> If you buy a hot dog AT the game, you can deduct 50% of the hot dog (separately invoiced), but 0% of the ticket.</p>

    <h2 id="business-meals">Client Meals (50%)</h2>
    <p>To deduct a meal with a client, the IRS requires:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Business Purpose:</strong> You must discuss business during the meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Not Lavish:</strong> It cannot be "lavish or extravagant." (A $200 steak is usually fine. A $2,000 bottle of wine is not).</li>
        <li><strong>Presence:</strong> You (the owner) or an employee must be present. You can't just buy the client dinner and not show up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="office-snacks">Office Parties & Snacks (50% vs 100%)</h2>
    <p><strong>Snacks:</strong> Providing coffee/bagels for the office is generally <strong>50% deductible</strong> now (it used to be 100% de minimis, but TCJA changed this).</p>
    <p><strong>Parties:</strong> Recreational social events for the benefit of <em>employees</em> (Team Building, Holiday Party) remain <strong>100% deductible</strong>. This is to encourage morale.</p>

    <h2 id="groceries">Can I Deduct Groceries?</h2>
    <p>We get this question constantly from "Digital Nomads" working from Airbnbs.</p>
    <p><strong>The Rule:</strong> Generally, NO.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario A:</strong> You are at home. You buy groceries to make lunch. <br/>
    <strong>Result:</strong> 0% Deductible. You have to eat to survive. It's personal.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario B:</strong> You are traveling (away from your Tax Home overnight). You buy groceries to save money instead of eating out. <br/>
    <strong>Result:</strong> 50% Deductible. Because you are traveling, your food costs are considered business sustenance.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario C:</strong> You are a Food Blogger reviewing the ingredients. <br/>
    <strong>Result:</strong> 100% Deductible (Supplies/materials), not Meals.</p>

    <h2 id="documentation">Required Proof (Who, What, Why)</h2>
    <p>For any meal >$75, the IRS strictly requires a receipt. But even for small meals, you must record the "5 W's":</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> Who did you eat with? (Name & Company).</li>
        <li><strong>Where:</strong> Name of restaurant.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> Date.</li>
        <li><strong>How Much:</strong> Amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> "Discussed Q3 Marketing Strategy." (This is the one everyone forgets).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Pro Tip: Write this on the physical receipt immediately, then snap a photo.</em></p>
