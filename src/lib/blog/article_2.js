        Deduction Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>📝 <strong>Receipt Rule:</strong> You must have a receipt for any expense over $75. (Though keeping all receipts is smarter).</li>
        <li>👔 <strong>Ordinary & Necessary:</strong> The golden rule. The expense must be "common" in your industry and "helpful" for your business.</li>
        <li>🚫 <strong>Personal Use:</strong> If you use your laptop 50% for Gaming, you can only deduct 50% of the cost.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>A deduction is not free money. It is a discount. If you spend $100 on a hard drive, and your tax rate is 30%, you save $30 in taxes. <br/>
    The goal is not to "spend money to save taxes." The goal is to "make sure every legitimate business cost is counted."</p>
