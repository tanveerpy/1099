        Mistake Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>📉 <strong>QBI:</strong> The "Qualified Business Income" deduction is free money (20% deduction). No receipts needed. Don't miss it.</li>
        <li>👔 <strong>Clothes:</strong> You cannot deduct suits or dresses. Only uniforms with logos or safety gear.</li>
        <li>🚗 <strong>Mileage:</strong> Tracking gas receipts is usually WORSE than tracking miles. The 69¢/mile rate (2026 est) is generous.</li>
        <li>🏠 <strong>Home Office:</strong> Claim it. The Simplified Method ($1,500) is audit-safe.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>We analyzed over 5,000 freelance tax returns. The same errors pop up over and over again. Some errors trigger audits (Bad). Some errors just mean you paid too much tax (Sad). Here is how to avoid both.</p>

    <h2 id="mistake-1">1. Forgetting the QBI (20% Off)</h2>
    <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You calculate your profit ($50,000) and pay tax on $50,000. <br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> The <strong>Qualified Business Income (QBI)</strong> deduction allows you to deduct 20% of your profit AUTOMATICALLY. <br/>
    $50,000 Profit -> $10,000 QBI Deduction -> Taxable Income $40,000. <br/>
    <strong>Cost of Error:</strong> At a 22% bracket, forgetting this costs you <strong>$2,200</strong> in extra tax.</p>

    <h2 id="mistake-2">2. Fear of the Home Office</h2>
    <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> "I heard claiming a home office triggers an audit, so I'll skip it." <br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> This advice is from 1995. In 2026, 40% of the workforce is remote. The IRS Simplified Method ($5/sqft) is designed specifically to be low-risk. Take the deduction.</p>

    <h2 id="mistake-3">3. Mixing Business & Personal</h2>
    <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You use your personal Chase Sapphire for everything "to get the points." <br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> This is called "Commingling." In an audit, the agent has the right to look at EVERY transaction on that card. If they see diapers and Disney+ subscriptions next to your server costs, they might throw out your business expenses entirely. Get a dedicated card.</p>

    <h2 id="mistake-4">4. Deducting "Street Clothes"</h2>
    <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> "I bought a nice suit for the client meeting. It's deductible." <br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> <strong>NO.</strong> IRS Rule: If it can be worn as "Street Wear," it is personal. <br/>
    Deductible: Scrub nurses, Safety boots, Mascot costumes, Shirts with the company logo. <br/>
    Not Deductible: Suits, Dresses, Gym clothes. (Even if you are a fitness influencer!)</p>

    <h2 id="mistake-5">5. Missing Startup Costs</h2>
    <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You launch in June. You drove to suppliers in March. You forget to deduct the March travel because "the business didn't exist." <br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> Section 195. You can deduct up to $5,000 of costs incurred BEFORE opening day. (See Article 15).</p>

    <h2 id="mistake-6">6. Ignoring State Taxes</h2>
    <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> "I live in Texas (0% tax), so I don't file state taxes." <br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> If you did work for a client in California or New York, you might have "Source Income" there. State tax nexus is tricky. Double check where your money came from. (See Article 25).</p>

    <h2 id="mistake-7">7. Filing Late (The 5% Hit)</h2>
    <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You don't have the money to pay, so you don't file the return. <br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> The penalty for Not Filing (5%/mo) is 10x higher than the penalty for Not Paying (0.5%/mo). <strong>ALWAYS FILE ON TIME</strong>, even if you attach a payment of $0.00.</p>

            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes. You sign the return "Under Penalty of Perjury." If there is an error, YOU owe the tax and interest. You can sue your accountant for the <em>penalty</em>, but you still owe the tax.</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Can I amend my return if I find a mistake?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes! You have 3 years to file Form 1040-X. If you realize you forgot the QBI deduction in 2024, you can file an amendment today and get a check from the IRS.</p>
