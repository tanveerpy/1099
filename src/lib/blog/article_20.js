        Damage Control Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>🚨 <strong>Golden Rule:</strong> File the return IMMEDIATELY. The penalty for not filing is 5% per month. The penalty for not paying is only 0.5% per month.</li>
        <li>🃏 <strong>Get Out of Jail Free:</strong> If you have a clean record for the last 3 years, you likely qualify for "First Time Abatement" (FTA).</li>
        <li>📅 <strong>Extensions:</strong> An extension to file (Form 4868) gives you until Oct 15 to file paperwork, but you still must PAY by April 15.</li>
        <li>💸 <strong>Interest:</strong> Interest accrues daily and cannot be abated (unless the IRS made an error).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>You woke up. It's April 16th. You realized you forgot to file your taxes. A pit forms in your stomach. Visions of jail cells dance in your head.</p>
    <p>Relax. You aren't going to jail. But you are about to pay an expensive "Stupidity Tax" unless you act fast. The IRS penalty system is designed to punish "ghosting" much harder than it punishes being broke.</p>

    <h2 id="penalty-math">The 5% vs 0.5% Rule</h2>
    <p>The IRS charges two separate penalties. Understanding the difference is crucial.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Failure to FILE Penalty (The Big One)</strong><br/>
    If you do not send in the paperwork, they charge you <strong>5% of your unpaid tax per month</strong> (capped at 25%).</p>
    <p><strong>2. Failure to PAY Penalty (The Small One)</strong><br/>
    If you file the paperwork but don't send the check, they charge you <strong>0.5% of your unpaid tax per month</strong> (capped at 25%).</p>
    <p><strong>The Insight:</strong> Not filing is <strong>10x more expensive</strong> than not paying. Even if you have $0 in your bank account, FILE THE RETURN to stop the 5% bleeding.</p>

    <h2 id="scenario-calc">Scenario: The $10,000 Mistake</h2>
    <p>Let's look at Mike. Mike owes the IRS $10,000. He is scared, so he hides for 5 months.</p>

    <h2 id="abatement">The "First Time Abatement" Card</h2>
    <p>If this is your first screw-up, the IRS has a secret mercy policy called <strong>First Time Abatement (FTA)</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>You filed the last 3 years of returns on time.</li>
        <li>You had no penalties in the last 3 years.</li>
        <li>You have now filed the current late return (you can't ask for abatement until you file).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How to Claim it:</strong><br/>
    Wait for the penalty notice to arrive in the mail. Call the phone number on the notice. Say these exact words: <br/>
    <em>"I would like to request First Time Abatement for the Failure to File and Failure to Pay penalties for the 2026 tax year. I have a clean compliance history for the prior three years."</em><br/>
    Result: They often wipe the penalties instantly over the phone. Interest, however, stays.</p>

    <h2 id="reasonable-cause">Reasonable Cause Defense</h2>
    <p>If you don't qualify for FTA (maybe you were late last year too), you can try "Reasonable Cause." This is harder.</p>
    <p><strong>Valid Reasons:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Fire, casualty, natural disaster (Hurricane).</li>
        <li>Inability to get records (your house burned down).</li>
        <li>Death, serious illness, or incapacitation of the taxpayer or immediate family.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Invalid Reasons:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>"I forgot."</li>
        <li>"I thought my accountant filed it."</li>
        <li>"I didn't have the money."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="state-penalties">Don't Forget the State</h2>
    <p>The IRS is just one creditor. Your state (California, New York, etc.) has its own penalty system. <br/>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> The IRS First Time Abatement does <strong>NOT</strong> apply to state taxes. You have to beg the state separately, and many (like California) are notoriously unforgiving.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Late Filing FAQs</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Does filing late extend the time they can audit me?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes. The 3-Year Audit Clock starts <em>on the day you file</em>. If you file 2 years late, you just extended the time the IRS can look at your finances by 2 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: I missed the extension deadline (Oct 15). Now what?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Just file. The penalties are capped at 25%. Once you hit 5 months late, the penalty stops growing (though interest keeps running). Filing is always the first step to fixing the problem.</p>
