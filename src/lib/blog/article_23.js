        Debt Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>🛑 <strong>Rule #1:</strong> FLIE ON TIME. Even if you can't pay a single dollar, file the return. The "Failure to File" penalty (5%/month) is 10x worse than the "Failure to Pay" penalty (0.5%/month).</li>
        <li>📅 <strong>Short Term:</strong> You can get a 180-day extension to pay with lower fees if you just ask.</li>
        <li>💳 <strong>Credit Card:</strong> Paying by credit card (1.87% fee) is often cheaper than the IRS combined interest + penalty rate (~14%).</li>
        <li>🏦 <strong>Setup Fee:</strong> Setting up a payment plan costs money ($31 to $130), so try to pay in full if you can.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>It's April 14th. You fill out your return. The number at the bottom says "Amount You Owe: $8,400." You check your bank account. It says "Balance: $400."</p>
    <p>Your instinct is to close the laptop and hide. <strong>DO NOT DO THIS.</strong> Hiding turns a manageable debt into a life-ruining financial crisis. The IRS is actually surprisingly flexible if you talk to them early, but they are ruthless if you ghost them.</p>

    <h2 id="panic-audit">Reason #1 to File Anyway: The 5% Penalty</h2>
    <p>There are two main penalties, and people confuse them.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Failure to PAY:</strong> This is for people who file the return but don't send the check. <br/>
        <strong>Cost:</strong> 0.5% per month. (6% per year).</li>
        <li><strong>Failure to FILE:</strong> This is for people who ghost the IRS. <br/>
        <strong>Cost:</strong> 5.0% per month. (60% per year).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The Math:</strong> On an $8,000 debt:<br/>
    If you File but Don't Pay: You owe <strong>$40/month</strong> in penalties.<br/>
    If you Don't File: You owe <strong>$400/month</strong> in penalties.<br/>
    <strong>Conclusion: FILE THE RETURN.</strong> Even if you don't send a check.</p>

    <h2 id="penalty-math">The True Cost of Debt (Interest Rates)</h2>
    <p>It's not just the penalty. You also pay <strong>Interest</strong>. The IRS interest rate is pegged to the Federal Short-Term Rate + 3%. In 2026, let's assume rates are 5%. So the IRS charges 8% interest.</p>
    <p><strong>Total "APR" of IRS Debt:</strong><br/>
    8% Interest + 6% Failure to Pay Penalty = <strong>~14% Effective APR.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Strategy Check:</strong><br/>
    If you have a Credit Card with a 24% APR, pay the IRS slowly. The IRS is cheaper.<br/>
    If you can get a Personal Loan at 9% APR, take the loan and pay the IRS. The loan is cheaper.</p>

    <h2 id="option-1">Option 1: Short-Term Payment Plan (180 Days)</h2>
    <p>If you just need a few months (maybe you're waiting for a big client invoice in June), apply for a <strong>Short-Term Payment Plan</strong> via the IRS Online Payment Agreement tool.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> Up to 180 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Setup Fee:</strong> $0.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest:</strong> Yes, it still accrues.</li>
        <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> No formal contract, no monthly auto-debit requirement. You just promise to pay it off by Day 180.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="option-2">Option 2: Installment Agreement (Long Term)</h2>
    <p>If you need years to pay, you need a formal Installment Agreement (Form 9465).</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> Up to 72 months (6 years).</li>
        <li><strong>Setup Fee:</strong> $31 (if online + Direct Debit) to $107 (if paper).</li>
        <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> You must setup Direct Debit. You cannot miss a payment. If you miss one, they cancel the plan and demand the full amount immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit:</strong> If you owe less than $50,000, this is automatically approved. You don't need to show financial statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="option-3">Option 3: OIC (The Nuclear Option)</h2>
    <p>You see late-night TV commercials: "We settled $50,000 of tax debt for $500!" <br/>
    This is called an <strong>Offer in Compromise (OIC)</strong>. It exists, but it is incredibly rare.</p>
    <p>To qualify, you must prove to the IRS that <em>you will never, ever be able to pay the full amount</em> before the 10-year Statute of Limitations expires. You have to list every asset you own (car, house, jewelry). The IRS will ask: "Why don't you sell your car to pay us?"</p>
    <p><strong>Acceptance Rate:</strong> Less than 30%. Do not count on this unless you are truly destitute.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Debt FAQs</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Does the IRS report to Credit Bureaus?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Generally, NO. Tax liens used to appear on credit reports, but the bureaus removed them in 2018. However, if you apply for a mortgage, the lender will check tax transcripts and see the debt.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Can I pay with a Credit Card?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes, through third-party processors (PayUSAtax, etc). They charge a fee of roughly 1.87% to 1.98%. If you have a card that gives 2% cash back (like Citi Double Cash), you effectively pay a 0% fee. This is a great hack to float the debt for an extra 30 days interest-free.</p>
