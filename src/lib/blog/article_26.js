        Creator Cheat Sheet
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>🎁 <strong>Gifts vs Income:</strong> If a brand sends you a $1,000 purse in exchange for a post, that is $1,000 of Taxable Income (Barter Income).</li>
        <li>👗 <strong>Clothing Rule:</strong> You cannot deduct clothes unless they are "Costumes" not suitable for street wear. A ballgown for a gala you film? Maybe. A t-shirt? No.</li>
        <li>🎥 <strong>Gear:</strong> Cameras, Lights, and Editing PCs are 100% deductible immediately using Section 179.</li>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Rentals:</strong> Renting clothes (Rent the Runway) for a specific shoot IS deductible as a "Prop." Buying them is not.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Being a Creator is a business, not a hobby. But the lines are blurry. When does your "Lifestyle" end and your "Content" begin? The IRS is targeting this sector aggressively because of the perceived abuse of "Lifestyle Deductions." They see Instagram models attempting to write off their entire existence—rent, food, clothes, gym, haircuts—as business expenses. That doesn't fly.</p>

    <h2 id="gifted-products">Are "Gifts" Taxable? (The Scary Truth)</h2>
    <p>This is the #1 area of non-compliance. Brands love "Gifting" because it feels casual. The IRS disagrees.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A skincare brand sends you a box of products worth $500. You didn't ask for it. You post a story about it.</p>
    <p><strong>IRS Rule:</strong> If there is an expectation of promotion (quid pro quo), the Fair Market Value ($500) is <strong>Barter Income</strong>. You must report $500 on your taxes.</p>
    <p><strong>The Deduction Problem:</strong> "But can't I deduct the $500?" No! You didn't pay for it. Expenses must be <em>paid</em>. So you have $500 of income and $0 of expense. You effectively owe ~$150 in tax on a box of lotion.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense Strategy:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Unwanted Gifts:</strong> If you receive unsolicited PR packages you don't want, donate them to charity immediately. This creates a charitable deduction (Schedule A) to offset the income, or proves you didn't "accept" the value.</li>
        <li><strong>No Post:</strong> If you never post about it, you can argue it was a true gift (Tax Free) and not a payment for services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="lifestyle-deductions">The Lifestyle Trap: Clothes & Gym</h2>
    <p><strong>Clothing:</strong> If you are a fashion blogger, you logically think the clothes you buy to review are deductible.<br/>
    <strong>IRS Reality:</strong> If the clothing is "suitable for everyday wear," it is PERSONAL. A Supreme hoodie is personal. A Spiderman costume is business. A tuxedo is personal (you could wear it to a wedding). <br/>
    <strong>The "Rent the Runway" Loophole:</strong> While <em>buying</em> a dress is hard to deduct, <em>renting</em> a dress for a specific photoshoot is easy. It is classified as a "Prop" rental. This is a much safer audit position.</p>

    <p><strong>Gym/Makeup:</strong> Unless you are a professional model/actor with a specific clause, maintaining your appearance is considered personal. You generally cannot deduct gym memberships, manicures, or haircuts, even if you are "on camera" all day. The IRS argues that you need to be fit/groomed for life, not just for YouTube.</p>

    <h2 id="equipment">Cameras, Studios & Tech (Section 179)</h2>
    <p>This is where creators win. You can use <strong>Section 179</strong> to write off 100% of the purchase price of assets in Year 1.</p>
    <p><strong>Eligible Gear:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Cameras / Lenses (Sony A7S III? Deduct it all).</li>
        <li>Gaming PCs / Consoles (for streamers).</li>
        <li>Microphones / Audio Interfaces.</li>
        <li>Set Design / Props (plants, neon signs, shelves).</li>
        <li>Smartphones (percentage of business use).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Usage Log:</strong> If you use that $4,000 camera to film your family vacation, you can only deduct the "Business Percentage" (e.g., 90%). Be honest.</p>

    <h2 id="digital-services">Software & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Don't forget your "Digital Rent." These add up to thousands.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Adobe Creative Cloud ($600/yr).</li>
        <li>Epidemic Sound / Artlist ($300/yr).</li>
        <li>Web Hosting / Domain Names.</li>
        <li>Dropbox / Google Drive.</li>
        <li>Social Media Schedulers (Buffer, Later).</li>
        <li>Email Marketing (ConvertKit, Mailchimp).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="home-studio">The Home Studio Debate</h2>
    <p>We covered Home Offices in Article 11, but for Creators, it involves the "Exclusive Use" test.</p>
    <p><strong>Pass:</strong> A spare bedroom used <em>only</em> for filming and editing. Deductible.</p>
    <p><strong>Fail:</strong> You film in your kitchen. You edit on the couch. Because those spaces are "mixed use," you get $0 deduction.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Partition a room. If you tape off a corner of your living room and put a green screen there, and <em>never</em> use that corner for anything else, that square footage counts.</p>

    <h2 id="travel">Travel for Collabs</h2>
    <p>Travel is a high-audit area. "I went to Coachella for content" is a red flag.</p>
    <p><strong>To deduct travel:</strong></p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>The primary purpose must be business. (More than 50% of days spent working).</li>
        <li>You need an itinerary. "Monday: Filmed collab with @User. Tuesday: Edited footage."</li>
        <li>You cannot deduct the travel of your spouse/friend unless they are a paid employee.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you do this, Flight/Hotel are 100% deductible. Meals are 50% deductible.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Creator FAQs</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Can I deduct games I play on Twitch?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes! If you are a streamer, the game software, in-game purchases (skins), and DLC are 100% deductible research/supplies.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Do I need to 1099 my video editor?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">If you pay them more than $600 in a year via Check, Zelle, or Bank Transfer, YES, you must issue them a 1099-NEC. If you pay them via PayPal/Upwork, NO (the platform handles it).</p>
