      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>📉 <strong>Tax Deduction:</strong> Every dollar you put in reduces your taxable income for the year. Put in $10,000? You just saved ~$3,000 in taxes.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>SEP-IRA:</strong> Easiest to set up. No annual paperwork. But limits are lower for people making under $200k.</li>
        <li>🚀 <strong>Solo 401(k):</strong> Higher contribution limits (allows "Employee" + "Employer" contributions). Allows loans. Harder paperwork (Form 5500).</li>
        <li>📅 <strong>Deadline:</strong> Solo 401(k) accounts MUST be opened by Dec 31. SEP-IRAs can be opened as late as April 15 (or Oct 15 with extension).</li>
      </ul>

    <p>As a freelancer, you don't have an HR department matching your 401(k). You are the HR department. The government gives self-employed people massive tax breaks to save for retirement, but 90% of freelancers overlook them and stick to a basic Robinhood account.</p>
    <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Using a taxable brokerage account means you pay tax on the income first (30% haircut) and then pay tax on the growth later. <br/>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> Using a SEP-IRA or Solo 401(k) lets you invest "Pre-Tax" money. It is the single biggest tax shelter available to the middle class.</p>

    <h2 id="the-basics">The Power of Tax-Advantaged Saving</h2>
    <p>In 2026, the estimated limit for total defined contributions is around <strong>$70,000</strong> (adjusted for inflation).</p>
    <p>If you earn $100,000 and contribute $20,000 to a SEP-IRA:<br/>
    1. Your Taxable Income drops to $80,000.<br/>
    2. You save ~$6,000 in taxes immediately.<br/>
    3. That $20,000 grows tax-deferred for 30 years.</p>

    <h2 id="sep-ira">SEP-IRA: The "Easy" Button</h2>
    <p><strong>Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> You, as the Employer, contribute a percentage of your salary to yourself, the Employee.</p>
    <p><strong>Contribution Limit:</strong> 25% of your Net Profit (adjusted). Effectively ~20% of your gross profit.</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li>Set up in 5 minutes at Vanguard/Fidelity.</li>
        <li>$0 setup fees.</li>
        <li>No annual IRS filing requirements.</li>
        <li>Can be set up LATE (up until the tax filing deadline).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li>No "Employee" Catch-up contributions.</li>
        <li>The 25% limit restricts you if your income is low. (e.g., If you make $50k, maximum contribution is only ~$12.5k).</li>
        <li>No Roth option (usually).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="solo-401k">Solo 401(k): The Power User Choice</h2>
    <p>Also called a "One-Participant 401(k)."</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> You wear two hats. <br/>
    Hat 1 (Employee): You can contribute up to ~$23,500 (Elective Deferral). <br/>
    Hat 2 (Employer): You can add another 25% of profits on top of that (Profit Sharing).</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Higher Limits:</strong> You can max it out even on a lower income.</li>
        <li><strong>Roth Option:</strong> You can contribute post-tax money (Roth Solo 401k) for tax-free growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Loans:</strong> You can borrow up to $50,000 from your own 401(k) emergency fund.</li>
        <li><strong>Mega Backdoor Roth:</strong> With custom plans, you can stuff even more away.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Paperwork:</strong> You must obtain an EIN.</li>
        <li><strong>Form 5500-EZ:</strong> Once you have >$250,000 in the account, you MUST file this form annually. If you forget, penalties are massive.</li>
        <li><strong>Strict Deadline:</strong> Must be opened by Dec 31.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong> With a Solo 401(k), this designer can tax-shelter almost half their income. With a SEP, they are capped much lower.</p>

    <h2 id="deadlines">Deadlines (Dec 31 vs April 15)</h2>
    <p>This is where most people get forced into a SEP.</p>
    <p><strong>The Solo 401(k) Trap:</strong> You must have the Trust Document signed and the plan active by <strong>December 31</strong> of the tax year. You don't have to fund it yet, but the plan must exist.</p>
    <p><strong>The SEP-IRA Safety Net:</strong> You can wake up on April 14th, realize you owe $10,000 in taxes, open a SEP-IRA that same day, contribute money for the <em>previous</em> year, and deduct it. It is the perfect procrastination tool.</p>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Can I have both a Solo 401(k) and a Day Job 401(k)?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes, but the "Employee Deferral" limit (~$23,500) is shared across ALL plans. If you max out your Day Job 401(k), you can't contribute the employee portion to your Solo 401(k). You can, however, still make the "Employer Profit Sharing" contribution (20%) to your Solo 401(k).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: What if I have employees?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Then you cannot use a Solo 401(k). It is only for "Solo" owners (and spouses). If you hire a full-time eligible employee, the plan must be terminated or converted to a complex (expensive) full 401(k). SEP-IRAs allow employees, but you must make the same % contribution for them as you do for yourself (very expensive).</p>
