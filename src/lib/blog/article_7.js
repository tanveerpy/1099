        Structure Cheat Sheet

      <ul class="space-y-2 text-indigo-800">
        <li>🛑 <strong>Tax Reality:</strong> A Single-Member LLC pays the <strong>EXACT SAME TAX</strong> as a Sole Proprietor. It does not save you a penny in taxes (unless you elect S-Corp status later).</li>
        <li>🛡️ <strong>Liability:</strong> It protects your personal house/car if a client sues you. That is the main purpose.</li>
        <li>💳 <strong>Credit:</strong> You cannot build "Business Credit" (getting a loan without a personal guarantee) without an LLC.</li>
        <li>💰 <strong>Fees:</strong> Some states are cheap ($50). Some are expensive (California is $800/year minimum).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>You start freelancing. Your friend says: "Bro, you gotta get an LLC for the write-offs." <br/>
    Your friend is wrong. <br/>
    An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a <strong>Legal</strong> structure, not a <strong>Tax</strong> structure. The IRS doesn't even recognize it exists. They look right through it ("Disregarded Entity") and tax you as an individual.</p>

    <h2 id="myth">The "LLC Tax Cut" Myth</h2>
    <p>Let's clear this up once and for all.</p>
    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
        <div class="border p-4 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Sole Proprietor</h4>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">You operate as "John Doe."</p>
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold mt-2">Deductions: 100% Allowed</p>
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold">Tax Rate: 15.3% + Income Tax</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border p-4 rounded-xl bg-indigo-50 border-indigo-200">
            <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Single-Member LLC</h4>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">You operate as "Doe Design LLC."</p>
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold mt-2">Deductions: 100% Allowed</p>
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold">Tax Rate: 15.3% + Income Tax</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Identical tax bill. The LLC just costs more to set up.</p>

    <h2 id="liability">Reason 1: Liability Protection (The Veil)</h2>
    <p>If you are a Sole Proprietor and you accidentally delete a client's database, and they sue you for $1 Million, they can take your <strong>Personal House</strong> and your <strong>Personal Car</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you have an LLC, they can only take the assets <em>inside</em> the company (the company laptop and bank account). Your house is safe.</p>
    <p><strong>Piercing the Corporate Veil:</strong> This protection vanishes if you mix funds. If you pay for your personal Netflix with the LLC debit card, a judge will say "This isn't a real company, it's just your piggy bank" and let the lawyers take your house. (See Article 19).</p>

    <h2 id="credibility">Reason 2: Credibility</h2>
    <p>This is psychological but real. <br/>
    <strong>Invoice A:</strong> "Pay to: Sarah Smith"<br/>
    <strong>Invoice B:</strong> "Pay to: Smith Consulting, LLC"</p>
    <p>Corporate clients prefer Invoice B. It feels safer. It lowers <em>their</em> risk of the IRS classifying you as a misclassified employee. Having an EIN and an LLC makes you look like a "Business," not a "Gig Worker." You can often charge 20% more just for looking professional.</p>

    <h2 id="banking">Reason 3: Banking & Credit</h2>
    <p>You often cannot open a true "Business Checking Account" (like Chase Business or Mercury) without Articles of Organization. <br/>
    Why does this matter? <br/>
    1. Separation of funds (Audit Proofing).<br/>
    2. Building credit. Eventually, you might want a Business Credit Card (Amex Plum) that doesn't report utilization to your personal credit score. You need an LLC for that.</p>

    <h2 id="cost">The Cost (The California Trap)</h2>
    <p>In most states (Wyoming, Delaware, Florida), an LLC costs ~$100/year. It's a no-brainer.</p>
    <p><strong>However, in California:</strong> <br/>
    There is an <strong>$800 Annual Franchise Tax</strong>. Even if your business earns $0. Even if you lose money. You owe the Franchise Tax Board $800 every year.<br/>
    If you are just starting out and only making $2,000, paying $800 for an LLC is a bad ROI.</p>

    <h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance (Annual Reports)</h2>
    <p>An LLC is like a pet. You have to feed it. Most states require an "Annual Report" (or "Statement of Information"). It's usually a simple form updating your address.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Scammers love this. You will get official-looking letters saying "PAY $200 NOW OR YOUR LLC DISSOLVES." These are scams. The real state fee is usually $20 or $50. Always go directly to your Secretary of State website.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">LLC FAQs</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: Can I be my own Registered Agent?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Yes, but your address becomes public record. If you work from home, this means your home address is on the internet. Everyone can see it. It is usually worth paying ~$100/year for a Registered Agent service to protect your privacy.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Q: When should I form the LLC?</h4>
            <p class="text-text-muted">Generally, wait until you have consistent income (e.g., $1,000/month). Don't spend $500 setting up a legal entity for an idea that hasn't made a dollar yet (unless you are in a high-risk industry like construction).</p>
